    <p>Hello! I'm Prisha Goyal and this is my personal page for a group GitHub project.</p>

    <p>
    Regarding my experience and goals in CS: <br>
    I've worked with Java, Javascript, HTML/CSS, Python, and C++ before. <br>
    I am interested in data science and cybersecurity as future careers in my CS journey. <br>
    I'm excited to help others with my skills in computer science over the years and through this process, hope to learn more about myself! <br>
    </p>

    <p>
    A little about me: <br>
    I like to dance, listen to music, bake, and go on walks in my free time. <br>
    My favorite artists right now are Chase Atlantic and Stray Kids.
