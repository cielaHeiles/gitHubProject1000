Hello! I'm Marjan Ataii and this is my personal page for a group GitHub project.

Regarding my experience and goals in CS:
I've worked with Java in high school and know a little HTML and CSS.
I am interested in learning more about web development and improving my coding skills.
Through this project, I hope to gain confidence in using GitHub and collaborating with others!

A little about me:
I love dancing and reading in my free time.
I don't have a favorite artist, but I enjoy exploring different genres of music and books.
