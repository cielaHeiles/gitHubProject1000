<h1>Ciela's Personal Page</h1>
<p>Hey there! I'm Ciela Heiles, and this is my personal page for the git hub project.

I have a few years of coding experience in Java, Python, and JavaScript, and am currently learning C++.
I am interested in software engineering and cybersecurity as career paths in CS.
I'm excited to learn more about computer science over the next few years and figure out what areas interest me!

A little about me:
I like going outside to rock climb, mountain bike, ski, hike, etc. 
I have two cats
My favorite book right now is A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara
